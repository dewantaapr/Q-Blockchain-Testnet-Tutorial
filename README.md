# What

On the Q Testnet, setup a validator node and maintain it with good uptime and correct operation.

# When

Registration will start in December 2022 and the monitoring phase will last from 1st January 2023 to 31st March 2023.

# Who

The Q Development AG is managing this as an incentive reward for active community members which want to become a Validator on Q Blockchain testnet and mainnet.

# Why

To educate about Q Consensus, diversify the validator set and provide validators the utility to run a mainnet validator and take part in Q governance.

# How much

The exact amount of rewards in Q Tokens per participant is not finalized. 
The amount will be selected to cover the cost for maintaining a Q client 
considering an average cloud provider cost for a series of about 6 months + a buffer for the maintenance efforts.

# Eligibility

Users need to register at https://itn.qdev.li/ , where the Q Testnet account will be connected to the Q Mainnet account and join the Q Discord Community Server. 
Given this, the user needs to run and maintain a Q client acting as validator on the Q testnet.

Quality behavior and fraud will be monitored and tracked for each participant (see monitoring phase below for further details). Only eligible users will be 
considered for rewards and the potential KYC process at Q Development.
